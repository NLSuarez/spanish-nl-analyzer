# Spanish-Word-Frequency-Analyzer

This is a freelance project for a high school Spanish teacher. The end goal is to create a program that analyzes a document, which can be .txt .docx or .pdf, and produce a list of words ordered from most frequent to least frequent. There will be a few caveats to add after this first step is accomplished:

1.  Group together like verbs
    1. Will require a dictionary of verbs to do that(There's 501 with multiple conjugations). Keep in mind we will not be able to differentiate between verbs/nouns for similarly spelled words without significantly more work than necessary.
2. Extract words from tables/charts/graphs if possible rather than just paragraphs for the end count.
